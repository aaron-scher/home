# Quantum Mechanics: Operators and Observables

**Prerequisites:** This builds on [Quantum Basis Representation](quantum-basis-representation.md) where we learned about states, bras, kets, and different basis representations. If you haven't read that yet, start there first!

## Coming Soon

This document will cover:

- **From Waves to Operators**: How differential operators extract physical quantities
- **Operators in Different Bases**: Position operator, momentum operator, energy operator (Hamiltonian)
- **Expectation Values**: Computing average values of observables
- **Eigenstates and Eigenvalues**: The measurement postulate
- **Commutators and Uncertainty**: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle

Content to be added from the restructuring of quantum-basis-representation.md.
