# About

This is a personal knowledge base where I document concepts, formulas, and workflows.

## Purpose

I have a tendency to forget things, so I write detailed notes in tutorial form. This helps me:

- Quickly refresh my memory on topics I've studied
- Maintain a searchable reference for formulas and concepts
- Build a structured knowledge base over time

## How It Works

Built with MkDocs Material and deployed via GitHub Pages. Math equations are rendered with MathJax.
