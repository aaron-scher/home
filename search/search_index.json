It's the time-dependent amplitude of mode \\(k\\). Remember our classical traveling wave solution \\(u_j = A e^{i(kja - \\omega t)}\\)? Here we've separated the spatial part (\\(e^{ikja}\\)) from the time part. The time dependence lives in \\(Q_k(t)\\), which oscillates as: \\(\\(Q_k(t) = Q_k(0) \\, e^{-i\\omega_k t}\\)\\) This comes from solving Newton's equation for mode \\(k\\): \\(\\ddot{Q}_k = -\\omega_k^2 Q_k\\) gives simple harmonic motion at frequency \\(\\omega_k\\).</p> <p>Why a discrete sum, not an integral? With \\(N\\) atoms in your chain, there are exactly \\(N\\) independent ways to wiggle them \u2014 hence \\(N\\) normal modes with \\(N\\) allowed \\(k\\) values. This comes from boundary conditions (periodic: \\(u_{j+N} = u_j\\), which forces \\(e^{ikNa} = 1\\), so \\(k = 2\\pi m / Na\\) for \\(m = 0, 1, ..., N-1\\)). In the thermodynamic limit \\(N \\to \\infty\\), the spacing between \\(k\\) values shrinks to zero and the sum becomes an integral: \\(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_k \\to \\frac{a}{2\\pi}\\int dk\\).</p> <p>Why complex exponentials? This is shorthand. The physical displacement \\(u_j\\) must be real. To get a real \\(u_j\\) from this sum, we need \\(Q_{-k} = Q_k^*\\) (complex conjugate). Then \\(Q_k e^{ikja} + Q_{-k} e^{-ikja} = 2\\text{Re}[Q_k e^{ikja}]\\), which is real. The complex form is mathematically cleaner than writing cosines with phases.</p> <p>What does a single mode look like?

It's the position of atom \\(j\\) along the chain. In a continuous medium you'd write \\(e^{ikx}\\); here we only have atoms at discrete positions \\(x_j = ja\\) (where \\(a\\) is the lattice spacing), so we write \\(e^{ikja}\\).</p> <p>Why is \\(k\\) limited to \\([-\\pi/a, \\pi/a]\\)? This is aliasing from discrete sampling!

It's just total energy = kinetic + potential. This formula exists in classical mechanics too (Hamilton wrote it down in the 1830s, before quantum mechanics). The first term is kinetic energy, the second is potential energy of a spring. \\(M_{\\text{eff}}\\) is an effective mass that comes from the coordinate transformation \u2014 for our simple chain it's just \\(M\\), the atomic mass.</p> <p>Now we do use Schr\u00f6dinger \u2014 but for the collective coordinate \\(Q_k\\), not for individual atom positions. Since \\(H_k\\) has the form of a harmonic oscillator, we know the answer: promote \\(Q_k\\) and \\(P_k\\) to operators, and the energy eigenvalues are \\((n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega\\).</p> <p>Key insight: There is a wavefunction \u2014 it's \\(\\Psi(Q_k)\\), a function of the collective coordinate (like the Gaussian ground state of a harmonic oscillator).
